        <h1>SPOILERS!!!</h1>
        <p>Wolverine and Deadpool have similar origin stories. Both received their powers (not totally willingly) via the Weapon X project. The shadowy group gave Logan (a.k.a. Wolverine) his Adamantium skeleton, and when Wade Wilson (a.k.a. Deadpool) was fighting cancer, they grafted Wolverine's healing factor onto Deadpool's DNA.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The fact that both characters can heal quickly from any wound also makes them ideal sparring partners. In the comics, Wolverine and Deadpool meet in 1994's Wolverine #88. Deadpool is throwing a fit after failing to win his ex back from her new boyfriend, and Wolverine intervenes. The two insult and stab each other until everyone is tuckered out.

            Deadpool and Wolverine have gone on to team-up or fight it out over the decades, in classic frenemies fashion.</p>

        <br>
        <p>Ryan Reynolds made his debut as the Merc with a Mouth in the much-pilloried X-Men Origins: Wolverine in 2009. In that film, the famously chatty Deadpool had his mouth sewn shut in an utterly bizarre creative zag from his comic book origins. Marvel fans didn't love it.
        The negative response to the movie motivated Reynolds to do justice to Deadpool in his own spinoff series. The actor has been on a (self-aware) apology tour ever since. In an end-credits scene for Deadpool 2, Deadpool actually travels back in time to murder the version of himself that starred in X-Men Origins. Expect similar fourth-wall breaking jokes in Deadpool & Wolverine.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>Hugh Jackman wanted to reprise his role as Wolverine after Logan</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Hugh Jackman initially said he was hanging up his claws after (spoiler alert) Wolverine died in 2017's Logan. Jackman made his debut as Wolverine way back in the 2000's X-Men, an seventeen years is a long time to maintain a superhero physique—though apparently not long enough.


        Reynolds has been publicly begging for a Deadpool-Wolverine crossover since the first Deadpool debuted. And ultimately, Jackman couldn't resist the allure of returning to his iconic character—and presumably the hefty paycheck offered for returning to the role.
            
         "I didn’t miss it for a long time," the actor told Variety. "And then, literally, it came to me one day as I was driving down to the beach. I knew I wanted to do this. I literally stopped the car, got out and called Ryan. He said, “Are you serious?” I said, “I’m serious.” And I hung up the phone.</p>

         <br>
         <p>
            When Marvel Studios launched the MCU with Iron Man in 2008, they didn't own the rights to some of Marvel Comics' most popular characters—namely, the X-Men, the Fantastic Four, and Spider-Man. Disney acquired Marvel Studios and, over the years, has brokered deals to scoop up those famous characters. Disney completed its acquisition of 21st Century Fox in 2019 and took over the rights to both the Fantastic Four and X-Men from that studio. (Marvel Studios has been making Spider-Man movies in collaboration with Sony, which still owns the rights to Peter Parker.)
         </p>
         <br>
         <p>This movie is, presumably, full of cameos. Multiversal movies usually are. Just like Disney tried to surprise audiences with the appearance of the old Spider-Men in Spider-Man: No Way Home or with John Krasinski's Mr. Fantastic in Multiverse of Madness, the studio is keeping the plot of Deadpool & Wolverine a secret.</p>
